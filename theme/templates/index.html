          <p>
            We are a group of experimental particle physicists interested in the application of modern machine learning (ML) techniques to analyze experimental physics data. Our research focus include geometrical pattern recognition for particle imaging detectors, understanding data/simulation discrepancies in altorithm response, and estimating uncertainties in ML applications.

            We welcome any researcher (physicist or none-physicist) to join our group and share the joy and struggle of problem solving in general. Please feel free to

            Currently our main focus is to levarage ML techniques, in particular deep neural networks, for reconstruction and analysis of data collected by a time projection chamber (TPC), a type of particle detector that allows 2D or 3D <i>imaging</i> of charged particle trajectories. We work on existing TPC detector data as well as DUNE, a future flagship experiment of the U.S. department of energy for the next decade.

              We are keen to share our work in public. You can find our active software development in public github repository, and most of our data set is made available <a href="{{ DATAURL }}">in public</a>. We take open-software and open-data effort seriously to make our work as much transparent and reproducible as possible. We also share our experience and interesting findings on our blog post.
